# AddressBook
This is a very simple Java application implementing an address book, in which the user can insert new contacts, or edit and delete existing ones.

The main purpose of this project was to explore a little bit of GUI programming in Java (using the Swing package), and try to come up with a nice organization structure with clear distinction between the model and the view, even for such a little project.
